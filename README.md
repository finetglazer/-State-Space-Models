# Mamba Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project structures the learning journey for Mamba models using a strategic bottom-up approach. Each component will be explored in depth with theory, code implementation, and practical applications.

## Learning Strategy

### For Each Component:

#### 1. Context Analysis
- Position in Mamba architecture
- Relevant aspects specific to Mamba implementation
- Interaction with other components
- Historical development and key papers

#### 2. Deep Implementation
- Theoretical foundations
- Code implementation (from scratch where possible)
- Visualization of key concepts
- Mini-projects demonstrating practical applications

#### 3. Integration & Evaluation
- Impact on overall model performance
- Potential optimizations and modifications
- Benchmarking against reference implementations
